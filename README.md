Welcome Warp Signs
==================
Welcome Warp Signs are an easy way for players on a Bukkit Minecraft server to make warps!

1. Each player can generate only one warp.
2. They create a warp by placing a sign that has [WELCOME] as the first line.
3. If the warp creation is successful, [WELCOME] will become green. If there is a problem, it will become red.

Warps are listed under /wwarps and are the player's name. Players can warp by typing /wwarp <name of warp>.

To destroy or remove a warp, the player should destroy or remove the sign. If signs get destroyed by the environment or another player, the warp is also removed.

The other lines on the sign can say anything and are ignored by the plugin.

The safety of a warp is checked before a player warps and if unsafe the warp is not allowed.
